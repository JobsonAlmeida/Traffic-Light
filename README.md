# <p align="center">  Traffic Light</p>


## Goal

This is a traffic light project that I have created as one of the projects required in the course [Treinamento em Lógica Ladder para CLP/PLC](https://www.udemy.com/course/treinamento-em-logica-ladder-para-plc/)



## Requirements 

The requirements to this project are described in the image bellow.

## Implementation 

The program was created using ZelioSoft2 software, which is one of the software created by Schneider Electrics for Ladder programming on their Zelio series PLCs.

To implement this project, I have used the CLP which reference is SR2A101BD. This SCLP has four digital outputs named Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. And it has four digital inputs named I1, I2, I3 and I4. I have associated the button required to input I1 and each one of the outputs with each one of the lights bulbs from the traffic lights as shown in the picture bellow
